# Analysis of lattice data

We collect data for the bosonic matrix model BMN with 2 matrices and gauge group SU(2)

## Python packages

You can install the dependencies for the scripts and the notebooks using [conda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/)
```shell
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

Check that the `fits` environment has been created and then activate it
```shell
conda env list
conda activate lattice-fits
```
